# Deformable Object Tracking with Gated Fusion
This repo provides the source codes and the benchmark results of the work "Deformable Object Tracking with Gated Fusion", accepted by *IEEE Trans. Image Processing, 2019*.

* Platform Prerequisites: Matlab R2017a, CUDA 8.0, NVIDIA GeForce 1080
* Notes: we currently provide part of the tracking code only and our project heavily relies on [MDNet](https://github.com/HyeonseobNam/MDNet). We also provide the benchmark results of VOT-2016, VOT-2017, OTB-100, and [Deform-SOT](https://sites.google.com/site/daviddo0323/projects/deform-sot). You can find the results in the ./benchmark_results directory.
